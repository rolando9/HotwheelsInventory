# HotwheelsInventory
Interactive database of my 1/64th scale cars inventory

This is my attempt to gather all of the information about
my Hotwheels/Matchbox vehicles in one database.

`HTML/CSS`
Will be used to create the front end GUI. This page will 
ask the person adding to the inventory for information like.

    Year, Make, Model, vehicle type, etc.
    
`Python`
Will be used to format, store, and filter the data on the 
back end.
